      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition, and machine vision.

                            Modern AI relies on powerful, specialised hardware like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These chips are engineered to handle the vast number of parallel calculations required for complex AI tasks, allowing systems to process data and find patterns far faster than traditional processors.

                            A key branch of AI, Machine Learning (ML) involves creating algorithms that allow computers to learn from data. Many ML systems use neural networks, which are modelled on the human brain, to recognise complex patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
