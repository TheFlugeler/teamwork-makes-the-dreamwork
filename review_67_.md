1. Content is interesting and consistent, covers different uses of computing throughout time

2. Consistency of the visual presentation could use some work, seems to be differerent styles and frameworks used between the pages instead of one consistent style. However the quality of each individual page is good, with clear framing and aesthetically pleasing formatting.

3. Written presentation is good, with a few typos and grammar issues on one page being the only problem.

4. HTML is all valid, no errors discovered

5. Each user committed their own page, and internally sent each other author pages (hence that doesn't show on the commit). Work balance seems equal from the commit history.
